    <div>       
        The Team JAC wiki is made by TechX students: Javier Diaz, Abhishek Khanal, and Christin Moreno. 
        The Wiki presents recommended video games from different genres, such as suspense, action, horror, adventure, sports and many more! 
        Are you up to the challenge to play these games? 
        What are your recommended games? 
        Feel free to  upload your thoughts on each game, or better yet, recommend a game that hasn't been listed yet!
